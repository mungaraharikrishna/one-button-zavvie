    When this application is deployed, the index.html won't be carried over.
    Instead, this <app-root> lives in a WP template.

    The <app-root> attributes listed here will be auto-populated by WP data.
    For testing here, however, you'll need to hard-code the values to your local environment.

    Legend:
    ---
    wpbaseurl: the base URL of the WP installation housing the OBZ.
      On the WP page, the value should be <?php echo get_site_url() ?>.
      When testing OBZ directly, the value should be something like http://localhost:4200.
      Do NOT include a trailing slash.
    apibaseurl: the base URL of the Lumen API instance.
        staging: https://api-staging.zavvie.com
        production: https://api.zavvie.com
    brid: Broker Id. Corresponds to WP post ID of broker platform record.
    brlandingpageid: Broker's main page WP post ID
    brapikey: API Key. Saved in WP broker platform (same as platform corresponding to ID) and exists in API.
    brapiintegration: WP setting for determining which systems to send inquiries. Current values:
      "PropertyBase",'PropertyBase and 2.0 API','2.0 API'
      see /zavvie-theme-child/classes/ZavvieCustomizer.php for exact values.
    brogo: Broker logo. Note, use a logo in same domain as wpbaseurl, otherwise pdf generation won't work.
    brcolor: broker color.
